# Climate Change

I founded the [Princeton Student Climate Initiative](psci.princeton.edu) in 2017 and led our two-year effort to develop a simple, effective, fiscally responsible climate policy for New Jersey.

# Outreach

I directed tech for the Princeton University Math Competition  ([PUMaC](pumac.princeton.edu)) in 2015 and 2016.

I was a volunteer tutor with the Petey Greene Prison Teaching Program.
