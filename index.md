Hello! I'm a medical student at Stanford University School of Medicine (graduation 2024) and an aspiring primary care physician-computer scientist. 

I'm trying to become a compassionate, competent family physician. And, I'd like to put my clinical experience with my computational training to address healthcare challenges. My [research background](research.md) is in machine learning, causal inference, statistics, and genomics.
